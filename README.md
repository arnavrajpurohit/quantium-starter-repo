Project Overview
This project addresses a series of tasks for Soul Foods, a fictional company. It demonstrates a complete data workflow, from raw data processing to creating an interactive web-based data visualiser and implementing automated testing.

The key features include:

Data Processing: Combines and cleans sales data from multiple CSV files.

Interactive Visualisation: A Dash web application displays a line chart of sales data.

User Filtering: A radio button allows users to filter the sales chart by region.

Test Suite: Programmatic tests ensure the application's key components are always present.

CI Automation: A bash script automates the process of running the test suite.
